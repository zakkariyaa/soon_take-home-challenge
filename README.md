# Soon_ Take Home Challenge
A simple basket app built with HTML/CSS/Javascript

## About 
The purpose of this project was to build a basic e-commerce site with a ***Product*** page and a ***Checkout*** page. <br />
The user should be able to to use the buttons on the page to update the amount of the items in the basket, <br />
and that should be reflected with the styles of the page. A strong emphasis was put into implementing these concepts into the project:
- Responsiveness.
- Test driven development (TDD).
- Accessability.
- Advanced HTML and CSS elements

## User stories

- Add a quantity of the product to the basket; see the total item count in the basket from the header

***Flow 2:***
- View a summary of the items in the basket
- Update quantity of items in the basket; this should automatically update the sub-total price and the item count (0 removes the item)
